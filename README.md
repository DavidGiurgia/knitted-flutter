# üöÄ Troop: Reimagining Social Connection

## Tired of the Toxic Scroll? We Built a Better Way.

Let's be real: modern social media often feels less "social" and more like a never-ending popularity contest mixed with an anxiety generator. At Troop, we believe technology should bring us closer, not pull us apart or leave us feeling inadequate.

**Troop is our answer:** A personal project born from a desire for a healthier, more authentic online space. Forget the algorithms, the public "likes," and the pressure to perform. Troop is about genuine connections, private conversations, and a feed that serves *you*, not advertisers.

## ‚ú® Our Vision: Social Media, De-Stressed

Our core vision is simple: **put the user back in control of their social experience.** We're not chasing viral trends or endless engagement metrics. Instead, we're building a platform where you can truly connect with your real-life circles, share authentically, and feel good about your online interactions.

## üéØ What Makes Troop Different?

We've designed Troop from the ground up to tackle the biggest issues with mainstream social platforms:

* **Your Circles, Your Rules:** No more broadcasting to the entire internet. With Troop, you define your social circles (think "Family," "Close Friends," "Work Buddies") and choose exactly who sees your posts. Your content, your audience, every time.

* **The End of the Popularity Contest:** We ditched public "likes," follower counts, and trending topics. Your value isn't a number. Share what truly matters to you, without the pressure of external validation.

* **Ephemeral Chats for Real Talk:** Need a quick, private, and temporary chat? Our unique ephemeral chat rooms let you connect instantly via a simple code or link. No accounts needed, no permanent history. Perfect for spontaneous discussions, quick collabs, or truly anonymous conversations.

* **Optional Anonymity, Built-In:** In specific contexts (like within certain communities), you can choose to post or message anonymously. Speak your mind freely, offer honest feedback, or discuss sensitive topics without exposing your identity.

* **Your Feed, Your Way (No Algorithms!):** Your feed is purely chronological and unfiltered. See posts only from your chosen circles and communities. No sneaky algorithms deciding what you see, no sponsored content, just the stuff from the people you care about.

* **Real Friendships, Not Just Connections:** We encourage meaningful connections. Our friendship system is mutual (both parties accept), and we've even set a friendly limit to encourage deeper, more manageable social bonds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Under the Hood

Troop is built with modern, scalable technologies to ensure a smooth and secure experience:

* **Backend:** Powering everything is **NestJS** (a robust Node.js framework) and **MongoDB** for flexible data storage. We use **JWT** for secure authentication and **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** for real-time chat magic. Our backend is deployed via **Railway** for stability and scalability.

* **Mobile App (Flutter):** Our beautiful mobile app is crafted with **Flutter**, allowing us to deliver a consistent, high-performance experience on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

* **Web App:** The web interface, currently focused on quick access to ephemeral chat rooms, is built with **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
