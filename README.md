## Knitted - Flutter App for Authentic Connection

**Knitted** is the official Flutter mobile app for the knitted-platform — a bold step toward rethinking what social media should be: meaningful, human, and healthy.

---

### Vision & Purpose

Today's mainstream social platforms often encourage:

- **Addiction through endless scrolling**
- **Toxic validation loops via likes and popularity metrics**
- **Shallow, non-authentic interactions**
- **Aggressive content algorithms** pushing irrelevant or harmful media

**Socialize** is different. This platform is designed to support:

- **Real, authentic connections** over metrics and influence
- **Intentional engagement** rather than passive consumption
- **A safe digital space**, free from manipulative design patterns
- **Privacy and user control** at the core of the experience

The Flutter app brings this vision to life with a clean interface, real-time communication, and secure interaction — all powered by a backend you control.

---

### What the App Offers

- **Simple, distraction-free UI**
- **Authentication with encrypted passwords and JWT tokens**
- **Real-time chat** via Socket.io
- **Responsive and fluid navigation across devices**
- **Direct connection with a custom NestJS & MongoDB backend**

This is not just a mobile frontend — it's part of a complete ecosystem that respects users.

---

### Why It Matters

Socialize Mobile invites users into a healthier digital environment. It encourages slower, intentional interaction with others. There are no "likes", no algorithmic rabbit holes, and no popularity contests — just people, conversations, and connection.

---

### Technical Note

While the focus is on concept and UX, the app is built with care using robust Flutter packages and well-structured architecture. Security and performance are prioritized.

---

### Status

Currently in development. Final release will follow the public launch of the platform.
